The plugin creates a specified and configured dungeon based on your settings in the configuration file. It places the dungeon schematic at a random location in the world, checking if the location is within a region and if the block is not lava or water. If the plugin fails to find a suitable location after 5 attempts, it sets the dungeon stage to a waiting mode and it will only spawn after the specified timer expires (Refresh in the cfg). The dungeon schematic must include a chest block, which you will specify in the configuration, otherwise, the plugin won't be able to process the schematic.
